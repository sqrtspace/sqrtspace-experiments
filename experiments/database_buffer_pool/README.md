# SQLite Buffer Pool Experiment

## Overview

This experiment demonstrates space-time tradeoffs in SQLite, the world's most deployed database engine. By varying the page cache size, we show how Williams' √n pattern appears in production database systems.

## Key Concepts

### Page Cache
- SQLite uses a page cache to keep frequently accessed database pages in memory
- Default: 2000 pages (can be changed with `PRAGMA cache_size`)
- Each page is typically 4KB-8KB

### Space-Time Tradeoff
- **Full cache O(n)**: All pages in memory, no disk I/O
- **√n cache**: Optimal balance for most workloads
- **Minimal cache**: Constant disk I/O, maximum memory savings

## Running the Experiments

### Quick Test
```bash
python test_sqlite_quick.py
```

### Full Experiment
```bash
python run_sqlite_experiment.py
```

### Heavy Workload Test
```bash
python sqlite_heavy_experiment.py
```
Tests with a 150MB database to force real I/O patterns.

## Results

Our experiments show:

1. **Modern SSDs reduce penalties**: Fast NVMe drives minimize the impact of cache misses
2. **Cache-friendly patterns**: Sequential access can be faster with smaller caches
3. **Real recommendations match theory**: SQLite docs recommend √(database_size) cache

## Real-World Impact

SQLite is used in:
- Every Android and iOS device
- Most web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Countless embedded systems
- Many desktop applications

The √n cache sizing is crucial for mobile devices with limited memory.

## Key Findings

- Theory predicts √n cache is optimal
- Practice shows modern hardware reduces penalties
- But √n sizing still recommended for diverse hardware
- Cache misses on mobile/embedded devices are expensive
