# Case Studies

Real-world examples demonstrating space-time tradeoffs in modern computing systems.

## Current Case Studies

### 1. Large Language Models (LLMs)
See `llm_transformers/` - Analysis of how transformer models exhibit space-time tradeoffs through:
- Model compression techniques (quantization, pruning)
- KV-cache optimization
- Flash Attention and memory-efficient attention mechanisms

## Planned Case Studies

### 2. Database Systems
- Query optimization strategies
- Index vs sequential scan tradeoffs
- In-memory vs disk-based processing

### 3. Blockchain Systems
- Full nodes vs light clients
- State pruning strategies
- Proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake memory requirements

### 4. Compiler Optimizations
- Register allocation strategies
- Loop unrolling vs code size
- JIT compilation tradeoffs

### 5. Distributed Computing
- MapReduce shuffle strategies
- Spark RDD persistence levels
- Message passing vs shared memory

## Contributing

Each case study should include:
1. Background on the system
2. Identification of space-time tradeoffs
3. Quantitative analysis where possible
4. Connection to theoretical results
